# Project-3

A web application is developed to simulate an electronic lock (creating the necessary elements using JS) with the following options.

A database of users and passwords to validate login.

A user registration option where only one registered user can log in.

When a user enters the wrong password 5 times, the lock is disabled for 30 seconds. 

When the user passes the login option they can only access the sections of their work (among the 10 available) assigned at the time of login. 10 available) assigned at the time of registration (e.g. Manuel, Bathroom and warehouse, Luis, Kitchen and offices...). offices...), the others are disabled.

Perform the application deployment in HEROKU of the developed application.
